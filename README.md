# Stock-Market-Prediction-using-News-Headlines
In this project, we have analyze the effect of news headlines on the rise and fall of the Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJIA). 
# Dataset 
We have used a dataset from Kaggle, which contains the top 25 news headlines from the Reddit WorldNews Channel in the dates ranging from 2008-06-08 to 2016-07-01.
The Stock data is the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), based on that a label has been created which has 2 values: "1" when DJIA Adj Close value rose or stayed as the same and "0" when DJIA Adj Close value decreased. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aaron7sun/stocknews)
# Goals 
The goal was to find determining keywords or phrases using NLP that have an impact on the stock price. Then we created multiple models, based on those keywords, to determine whether or not the stock price will go up or down and compared their accuracies to see which model performs the best.
